class TokenSamplingRecord:
    """Immutable record of a single token sampling event.

    Captures all information about one token's sampling pipeline execution
    for diagnostic analysis and consciousness-influence research.

    Attributes:
        timestamp_ns: Wall-clock time of sampling (nanoseconds since epoch).
        entropy_fetch_ms: Time to fetch entropy (milliseconds).
        total_sampling_ms: Total time for the full sampling pipeline (ms).
        entropy_source_used: Name of the entropy source that provided bytes.
        entropy_is_fallback: True if a fallback source was used.
        sample_mean: Mean of raw entropy bytes (expected ~127.5 unbiased).
        z_score: Z-score from signal amplification.
        u_value: Uniform value from amplification, in (0, 1).
        temperature_strategy: Name of the temperature strategy used.
        shannon_entropy: Shannon entropy of the logit distribution (nats).
        temperature_used: Final temperature applied.
        token_id: Vocabulary index of the selected token.
        token_rank: Rank of selected token (0 = most probable).
        token_prob: Probability of the selected token.
        num_candidates: Number of tokens surviving filtering.
        config_hash: 16-char SHA-256 prefix of the active config.
        injection_alpha: Effective logit perturbation alpha (after adaptive scaling).
        injection_beta: Effective temperature modulation beta (after adaptive scaling).
        injection_step: Effective selection drift step (after adaptive scaling).
        injection_scale: Adaptive injection scale factor applied to all injection methods.
